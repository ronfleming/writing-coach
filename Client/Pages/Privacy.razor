        <p>

            project created and operated by Ron Fleming. Questions or requests can be sent to

        <h2>What data we collect</h2>
        <p><strong>When you use the tool without signing in:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your text is sent to OpenAI's API for analysis. We do not store it.</li>
            <li>Standard server logs (request timestamps, response codes) are retained for operational monitoring via Azure Application Insights.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>When you sign in:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A user identifier and display name provided by your authentication provider (GitHub, Microsoft, or Google).</li>
            <li>Your coaching session history — the text you submitted and the AI's response.</li>
            <li>Phrases extracted from your coaching sessions into your phrase bank.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not collect your email address, phone number, payment information, or any other personal data beyond what is listed above.</p>

    <section class="about-section">
        <h2>How we use your data</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To display your session history and phrase bank to you.</li>
            <li>To associate your data with your account so it persists across devices and sessions.</li>
            <li>To monitor service health and diagnose errors (Application Insights telemetry).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not sell your data, share it with third parties for advertising, or use it to train AI models.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="about-section">
        <h2>Third-party services</h2>
        <p><strong>OpenAI:</strong> Text you submit is processed by OpenAI's API. OpenAI may retain API inputs per their own policies. See <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Authentication providers:</strong> Sign-in is handled by Azure Static Web Apps built-in auth. We receive only your user ID and display name — we never see your password.</p>
        <p><strong>Azure:</strong> Data is stored in Azure Cosmos DB in the East US region. Microsoft's data processing terms apply to infrastructure-level operations.</p>
        <p><strong>Application Insights:</strong> We collect anonymized telemetry (page views, errors, performance) for operational purposes. No personally identifiable information is intentionally included in telemetry.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="about-section">
        <h2>Cookies and tracking</h2>
        <p>
            We do not use advertising cookies or third-party tracking. Authentication sessions use a session 
            cookie set by Azure Static Web Apps. Application Insights may set a session cookie for correlation 
            of telemetry events.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="about-section">
        <h2>Your rights</h2>
        <p>You can delete all data associated with your account at any time from the <a href="/about-us">About Us</a> page. This permanently deletes your session history and phrase bank.</p>
        <p>
            If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), you also have the right to request access to, 
            rectification of, or erasure of your personal data under the GDPR. Contact us at 
            <a href="mailto:privacy@germanwritingcoach.com">privacy@germanwritingcoach.com</a> for any such requests.

    <section class="about-section">
        <h2>Data retention</h2>
        <p>
            Signed-in user data (sessions and phrases) is retained indefinitely until you delete it. 
            Server logs and telemetry are retained for 90 days per Azure Application Insights defaults.
        </p>

    <section class="about-section">
        <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this policy as the service evolves. Material changes will be noted with an updated
