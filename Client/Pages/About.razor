        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>
            Writing Coach is an AI-powered tool that helps language learners transform rough drafts into 
            polished, natural prose. It's designed for learners preparing for advanced proficiency levels 
            (B2/C1) who need practical feedback on real-world writing tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike simple grammar checkers, Writing Coach provides:
        </p>

            <li><strong>Targeted feedback</strong> — Learn from your specific mistakes with memorable rules</li>
            <li><strong>Phrase bank extraction</strong> — Build your vocabulary with reusable expressions</li>
            <li><strong>Context awareness</strong> — Get register-appropriate suggestions for professional, bureaucratic, or casual contexts</li>

        <h2>Who built this?</h2>
        <p>
            This tool was created by <a href="https://ronfleming.com" target="_blank">Ron Fleming</a>, 
            a software developer and US Army veteran currently preparing for C1-level German proficiency 
            as part of a move to Germany.
        </p>
        <p>
            Writing Coach started as a personal tool to accelerate language learning through practical 
            writing practice. It demonstrates real-world AI integration in a .NET application while 
            solving a genuine problem: turning language study into actionable, reusable learning artifacts.
